        svn checkout --username <LDAP_USERNAME> https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/svn/mos-oper/mos_shared/branches/cigcld_2017

        Compile 4-byte and 8-byte mdl libraries

        module use $PWD/modulefiles # Perform this at the root of the working copy
        module load mos_shared # This will load the highest version number of mos_shared (v2.6.3)
        cd lib/sorc/mdl
        ./makelibmdl_intel.sh
        mv libmdl_4_intel.a libmdl_8_intel.a ../../lib/.

        Compile MDL programs (itdlp and mdl_*)

        cd sorc/
        ./make-all-mdl-programs.sh


        NOTE: When running make-all-mdl-programs.sh, the first prompt is to set the module path which contains the module for the to-be implemented version of mos_shared. The second prompt will ask you to specify the library path that contains mdllib .a file created in Step 2. Please use full paths not relative.
