C        PURPOSE 
C            TO READ A STATION LIST AND ASSOCIATED INFORMATION FROM A
C            STATION DIRECTORY.  THE LIST (8 CALL LETTERS) CAN BE TAKEN
C            FROM THE DIRECTORY, IN WHICH CASE ALL STATIONS IN THE
C            DIRECTORY WILL BE USED, OR CAN BE ON THE DEFAULT INPUT
C            FILE, OR CAN BE ON A COMPLETELY SEPARATE FILE.  NOTE
C            THAT A SEPARATE STATION LIST CANNOT BE ON THE SAME FILE
C            AS THE DIRECTORY.  THE STATION LIST IS PUT INTO CCALL( ,1),
C            WITH UP TO 5 SUBSTITUTE STATIONS IN CCALL( ,J),J=2,6).
C            CCALL( , ) SHOULD BE DECLARED CHARACTER*8 IN THE CALLING
C            PROGRAM.  WHEN THE STATION LIST IS NOT TAKEN FROM THE
C            DIRECTORY (THE USUAL CIRCUMSTANCE), THE CALL TO RDC
C            IS SET TO READ UP TO NT = 7 VALUES PER RECORD ACCORDING 
C            TO THE FORMAT (7(A8,1X)); HOWEVER, THE RECORD NEED NOT
C            HAVE THAT MANY VALUES.  THE STATIONS IN THE LIST RETURNED 
C            IN CCALL( ,1) WILL BE IN THE ORDER READ IN.  DUPLICATE
C            STATIONS IN THE SEPARATE LIST WILL BE KEPT, BUT A 
C            DIAGNOSTIC IS OUTPUT.  NOTE THAT THIS ROUTINE CAN BE 
C            USED FOR A "GROUP" OF STATIONS, NOT NECESSARILY THE
C            COMPLETE LIST.  IN THAT CASE, THE CALLING PROGRAM WILL
C            PROVIDE THE LOCATIONS IN THE ARRAYS WHERE THE GROUP
C            LIST IS TO START, AND ND1 WILL BE THE SPACE LEFT THAT
C            CAN BE FILLED.  A "DUPLICATE" IS COUNTED AS SUCH ONLY
C            WITHIN A GROUP.  IT IS ASSUMED ARRAYS TO BE FILLED ARE
C            INITIALIZED BEFORE ENTRY.  THE LIST RETURNED IN 
C            CCALL( ,1) WILL ALWAYS CONFORM TO THE VARIABLE "NEW."
C            THAT IS, WHEN NEW = 1, THE STATIONS RETURNED IN 
C            CCALL( , 1) WILL ALWAYS BE ICAO CALL LETTERS (PROVIDED
C            THE DIRECTORY HAS ICAO CALL LETTERS FIRST) AND THE
C            STATIONS RETURNED IN CCALL( ,2), THE FIRST ALTERNATE,
C            WILL ALWAYS BE THE OLD CALL LETTERS (PROVIDED THEY
C            ARE THE FIRST ALTERNATE IN THE DIRECTORY).
C
C            NOTE THAT, IN THE STATION DIRECTORY, IF THERE IS THE
C            SAME LINK IN MORE THAN ONE DIRECTORY ENTRY, OR EVEN
C            IF THE OLD CALL LETTERS ENTRY IS THE SAME AS A LINK TO 
C            ANOTHER ICAO ENTRY, THE DESIRED STATION MAY NOT BE
C            ACCESSED.  THIS IS AN AMBIGUITY NOT DEALT WITH.
C
C            NOTE:  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS RDSTQN AND RDSTQA IS 
C                   THAT RDSTQA ALPHABETIZES STATIONS, WHILE RDSTQN
C                   DOES NOT.  RDSTQN DIFFERS FROM OTHER READERS
C                   IN THAT DATA FROM THE BLOCK/STATION NUMBER
C                   FIELD IS RETURNED WHILE OTHERS DO NOT RETURN
C                   SUCH DATA.  IN U155, THIS FIELD IS USED FOR QUALITY
C                   CONTROL FLAGS.  ALSO, THE ELEVATIONS ARE RETURNED
C                   AS REAL IN METERS.
