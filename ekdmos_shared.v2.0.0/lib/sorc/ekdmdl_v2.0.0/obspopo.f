C        PURPOSE 
C            THIS SUBROUTINE WILL CONVERT THE OBSERVATIONAL PRESENT
C            WEATHER REPORTS INTO A PRECIPITATION OCCURRENCE DESIGNATION OF

C
C            THE FOLLOWING IDPARS(1) AND IDPARS(2) ARE ACCOMMODATED:

C            DATA ARCHIVE CHANGED FROM SAO TO METAR ON DECEMBER 1, 1996,

C            DATA AND ONE SET OF NUMBERS FOR THE METAR DATA.  THIS
